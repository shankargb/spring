JUnit
===========

What is Unit Testing & Why?
    UNIT Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.
    The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.
    Unit Testing is done during the development(coding phase) of an application by the developers
    Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness.
    A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

    Junit is a free and open source Unit Testing framework for Java applications.
    Junit was developed by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma

Junit Assertions
    Junit 5 assertions help us in validating the expected output with the actual output of a test case
    In Short, assertions are nothing but static methods that we call in our tests to verify expected behaviour
    All Junit Jupiter assertions are present in the org.junit.jupiter.Assertions class

Junit Assertion Methods
      assertEquals
      assertNotEquals
      assertTrue
      assertFalse
      assertNull
      assertNotNull
      assertSame
      assrtNotSame
      assertThrows
